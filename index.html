    <h1>What is Climate Change?</h1>
    <p>Climate change is significant long term changes in the Earth's temperature and weather. With it, comes various negative impacts for the environment and those living on it. Such as heatwaves, droughts, melting glaciers which lead to floods and rising sea levels, and more unpredictable weather.

    <h1>Causes of Climate Change</h1>
    <p>One of the main causes of climate change are greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases consist of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The biggest contributer to the creation of greenhouse gases is when fossil fuels are burned for things like electricity and heat. These gases build up in Earth's atmosphere and trap in incoming heat and in turn warm up the Earth's climate.

    <h1>Ways to Combat Climate Change</h1>
    <p>Despite climate change being such a persistant problem, there are still things we, as normal citizens living our day to day lives, can do to help mitigate its effects. Such as reducing our carbon footprints which is the amount of greenhouse gases in total that we produce through our actions. Some ways you could reduce your carbon footprint would be reducing the amount of energy you use, using public transportation rather than a car, and even cutting back on how much meat you eat. These are all ways you can efficiently lessen your carbon footprint.
